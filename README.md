Use the `trips-for-route` endpoint: https://api.pugetsound.onebusaway.org/api/where/trips-for-route/1_100224.json?key=TEST

- Allow a user to input a route id via the user interface
- take route id and generate URL at trips-for-route endpoint.

Parse and display the following from endpoint:
- location of current busses
- stops for current route.

  maybe add other relevant info to UI outside of map.
